# Overview
## Components Required.
1. Existing kuberenetes cluster.
2. Jacoco injected agent service image.
3. Shared volume for file sharing between pods.

## Steps.
1.  __Create a Shared Volume.__\
    First we need a shared volume, which our services can use to share the .exec files generated by the jacoco agent.\
    *   Using AWS Elastic File System.
        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f ./Volume-Mounts/EFS/volume-config.yaml
        ```
    *   Using Windows File System.
        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f ./Volume-Mounts/Windows-filesystem/volume-config.yaml
        ```
2.  __Publish the jacoco-sidecar image__
