# ðŸš€ JaCoCo: Measuring Code Coverage in Java Projects

JaCoCo (Java Code Coverage) is a powerful tool for assessing code coverage in Java applications. It provides insights into how much of your codebase is exercised during automated tests. In this project, we'll explore how to generate an auto-instrumentation report for a Java service using the JaCoCo Java agent.

## ðŸš¨Key Points
- **What is JaCoCo?**
  - JaCoCo is a code coverage reports generator specifically designed for Java projects.
  - It helps you understand which lines of code are executed during testing.

- **Auto-Instrumentation with JaCoCo:**
  - By integrating the JaCoCo Java agent, you can automatically instrument your code to collect coverage data.
  - The agent instruments the bytecode on-the-fly during test execution.

- **Generating Reports:**
  - JaCoCo generates detailed reports in formats like HTML, CSV, and XML.
  - These reports provide insights into coverage at the class and method levels.
